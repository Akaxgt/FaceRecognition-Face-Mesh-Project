MediaPipe:
MediaPipe offers open source cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media.

Working - MediaPipe Face Mesh:

MediaPipe Face Mesh is a solution that estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer the 3D facial surface, requiring only a single camera input without the need for a dedicated depth sensor. Utilizing lightweight model architectures together with GPU acceleration throughout the pipeline, the solution delivers real-time performance critical for live experiences.

The solution is bundled with the Face Transform module that bridges the gap between the face landmark estimation and useful real-time augmented reality (AR) applications. It establishes a metric 3D space and uses the face landmark screen positions to estimate a face transform within that space.
